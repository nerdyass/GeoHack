Custom GeoGuesser Cheat

Showcase video: https://youtu.be/zAYroTQmJro

# Info:
Don't DM me on discord or anywhere asking hwo to set this up, it's a simple TamperMonkey script, there's plenty of tutorials (I won't respond)
I don't plan on updating this. It was first/last updated @ public release which was 23/9/2024 - some aspects may be patched now.
Feel free to edit this script however you like, if you do something cool with it, send it in my discord: discord.gg/nerdyass

# Dependencies:
Use TamperMonkey: https://www.tampermonkey.net/ to run this script

# Bind:
Default toggle bind: 't'.

# Credits:
Thanks to this older cheat: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/450253-geoguessr-location-resolver-works-in-all-modes for providing the XML clientside intercept function.
If you'd like to learn more about it, his github has a whole writeup about cheating in geoguesser & was a large resource in producing this!
